# GEF IEO Pakistan

This is a map made with Leaflet package in R showing the following layers:

1. GEF projects of Pakistan portfolio.

2. High biodiversity areas. A composite of all unprotected areas not captured by Species rarity sites, encompassing two major land classifications: biodiversity hotspots and high beta biodiversity areas.

3. Intact wilderness areas. Derived from 'Are we capturing faunal intactness?' (Plumtree et al 2019) and 'Sixteen years of change in the global terrestrial human footprint' (Venter et al 2016).

4. Protected areas. Protected areas are obtained via the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) which claims to be the most comprehensive global database on terrestrial and marine protected areas and provides the data in shapefile format.

6. Local Community Lands. LandMark data for Pakistan is not available.

7. Indigenous Population and Local Communities (IPLC) hotspot. According to Zadi (2021), Pakistani law does not recognize indigenous people. Instead, the government tags these communities as tribal people, ethnic, or religious minorities. Although Zadi (2021) lists several IPLCs, only four were found with location information: Balochi, Kalash, Gilgit, and the communities that are part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).

9. Conflict events resulting in at least 1 fatality for different GEF periods.

** Note: Pakistan has a relatively large number of conflict events with fatalities. The layer showing their location makes the map interface respond slowly when they are displayed on the map, especially with slower computer processors and low bandwidth internet access. Please only toggle on these layers when necessary for a smoother map-exploring experience.
